# JFoenix
JavaFX Material Design Library

# Summary
Summary

# Source Code
To rebuild JFoenix, we created an Ant file named build.xml and build.bat. JFoenix uses Java 1.8 version. Using a command line, you need to move to JFoenix make directory
and run the batch file build.bat by typing:

    build.bat

To run the main dmeo, in JFoenix make directory run the batch file run-demo.bat :

    run-demp.bat

(NOTE : you need to update the build.bat to point to Java 1.8 and Apache Ant directories)
